Ensure the JSON is well-formatted, with meaningful questions, accurate multiple-choice answers, and a correct answer clearly indicated. The questions should cover theoretical concepts, calculations, applications, and real-world scenarios."
Also give just the json response, without explaination without anything other then the json, with even this ```json  ....  ``` pattern.
